# Lyon's Den
A mobile utility app designed for use at *William Lyon Mackenzie CI*.  
This project was created by Tamir Arnesty and Inal Gotov to improve the daily experience of students and staff at *William Lyon Mackenzie CI*.  
Our goal was to bring all of the information someone would need throughout the day into one convenient place that is always accessible and up to date.  
**Lyon's Den** was created for that purpose itself, and it is a self-sustained project that constantly has the newest information.
